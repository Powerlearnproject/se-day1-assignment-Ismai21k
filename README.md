List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Ideation (Planning & Requirement Analysis)
This is the initial phase where the project idea is conceptualized. Requirements are gathered, feasibility is analyzed, and a development plan is created to ensure the project meets business and user needs.

Designing (System & Software Design)
In this phase, architects and developers create the software's blueprint, including system architecture, user interface, and database structure. This step ensures a structured approach before development begins.

Development (Implementation & Coding)
Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This phase involves programming, integrating different components, and following coding best practices to build a functional application.

Testing (Quality Assurance & Debugging)
The software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Testing ensures the application functions correctly and meets the defined requirements.

Deployment (Release & Implementation)
The tested software is released for users. This could be in the form of a full launch, phased rollout, or beta release. Deployment strategies vary based on the project requirements and user base.

Maintenance (Updates & Improvements)
After deployment, ongoing maintenance is required to fix bugs, release updates, and enhance performance. This phase ensures the software remains functional and relevant over time.




Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology: A linear, sequential process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next, and the final product is delivered at the end of the development cycle.

Agile methodology : An iterative and flexible approach that allows for changes and continuous improvements, and Product is developed and delivered in small increments (sprints).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
> A software developer is responsible for building and maintaining software application.
> Quality assurance Engineer: A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards by testing and identifying defects.
> Project manager: Project Manager oversees the development process, ensuring the project stays on track and meets deadlines.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
>Intergrated Development Environment(IDEs): An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing, editing, debugging, and testing code.
>Version Control system(VCS): A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to their code over time.
